Welcome to my Chess Game repository! This project is a command-line implementation of the classic game of chess written in Java. I did this project with my partner Charley Hatterman at the Univeristy of Minnesota. 

Features:
* Full Chess Game: Play a complete game of chess against another human player.
* Move Validation: Ensure that all moves adhere to the rules of chess.
* Check and Checkmate Detection: Detect when a player is in check or has been checkmated.
* Pawn Promotion: Implementation of special chess moves and rules.
